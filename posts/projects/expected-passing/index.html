<p>There is a dearth of public work on passing probabilities in football. Several companies and teams have carried out analysis of passing probability in football, but they are not publicly available. For example, Opta have their own expected passing model which they call xP (‘Introducing Expected Pass Completion (xP)’, 2021). The variables they use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>x-coordinate of pass start location</li>
<li>mirrored y-coordinate of pass start location (e.g. so a pass played from the left edge of the penalty area and a pass played from the right edge of the penalty area would both take the value 20.1)</li>
<li>angle of pass based on end location</li>
<li>approximate distance of pass based on end location</li>
</ul>
<p>American Soccer Analysis have their own Expected Passing Model (Kullowatz, 2018) with similar features. There has also been a lot of work done with regards to how pressure from opposing players affects shots at goal. However, there are no existing passing models in the public domain that consider pressure from opposing players mixed with a traditional passing model.</p>
<p>The main aim of this project was to create an expected passing model that takes pressure from opponents into account and to see if it was possible to model such an outcome. And from there a couple of research questions were defined: ‘what are the important features of a pass’s outcome?’ and ‘is it possible to model the probability of a pass outcome?’ For modelling, an inferential model was created and then a selection of models had to be chosen to apply to the data before being compared against each other. The variable to be predicted was ‘Complete’ or ‘Incomplete’ and therefore, a classification model was the obvious choice. The four models chosen were mentioned previously as they offered a range of benefits, but some had disadvantages.</p>

<p>I tried various models but the best results came from the Random Forest model. So, let&rsquo;s focus on that.</p>

<p>The implications of a real-time passing probability model are many. Anyone can play a pass sideways to a teammate and in recent years, we have seen a focus being put on players capable of breaking lines and receiving between the lines. Progressive passes are how you hurt teams. If we can quantify how difficult a pass is, we can determine how brave they are, how good they are at deciding what risks to take and how often those risks pay off.</p>
<p>We can also add up the cumulative risk taken during a specific sequence of play that led to a shot or goal.</p>
