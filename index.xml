      <description>I decided to pick my ten favourite musicians using Spotify&amp;rsquo;s developer tools, scrape the lyrics using Genius&amp;rsquo; API and then create a song using Markovify.
According to Spotify, my top ten bands of all time are.
So I used Python to scrape Genius and came back with a file.
Markovify is a library that. You can read more about it here&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>The nflverse is pretty amazing. So is Shiny, if not a little tricky to figure out. I decided to combine the two to create an Expected Rushing Yards model that would publish the results through Shiny.
The main goal of this project was to create a Shiny app with multiple pages and a navigation bar. Therefore, the model the rushing yards are predicted using is linear regression with rushing yards, down and seconds remaining in the half as the variables.</description>

      <description>I like data - especially as it relates to my other hobbies {sport, books, music, movies}. I mostly code in R, Python and Javascript. I also develop apps using Shiny, React, Node, Gatsby and others.
I write too. You can have a look at some of the things I have written here.
Please feel free to get in touch.</description>
